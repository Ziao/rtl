### Todo
- [x] Set up Prettier

### Things I would add
- Handle UI cases such as articles with `showVideoIcon` or `isPremium`.
- Bother someone about the meaning of all the fields, hopefully this is documented somewhere (openapi spec?). 
- Come up with a better look for the page, as well has a proper jumbo component. Time did not allow for this.
- Write more tests, especially for the `LazyImage` and `ItemGridItem` components.
